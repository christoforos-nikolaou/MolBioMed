## Course Objectives 
* Broad Picture: To remind you stuff you have chosen to forget after convincing you they were relevant all along. [Analytical thinking, quantitative approaches, statistical inference]
* Concepts: To give you an overview of the problems solved by computational and algorithmic approaches in modern biomedicine.
* Skillset: To show you how to perform (but more importantly how to interpret) standard bioinformatics analyses on genomic data.[Gene Expression, Functional Analysis, Modeling of biological data]

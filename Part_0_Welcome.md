## Course Structure
* 9 Lectures on topics related to computational and statistical approaches of molecular/biomedical problems
* Readings to be performed BEFORE each class. (https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass) _(You have been warned)_
* Topics and questions to be discussed in class
* Final evaluation will consist of written essay(s) and an in-class presentations.

## Course Objectives 
* Broad Picture: To remind you stuff you have chosen to forget after convincing you they were relevant all along. [Analytical thinking, quantitative approaches, statistical inference]
* Concepts: To give you an overview of the problems solved by computational and algorithmic approaches in modern biomedicine.
* Skillset: To show you how to perform (but more importantly how to interpret) standard bioinformatics analyses on genomic data.[Gene Expression, Functional Analysis, Modeling of biological data]

## Part A. Discussing skills

## Which skills? and for what?
* How many of your parents are working? 
* What do they do? 
* How long have they been doing it?

## What job would you want to do?
* For how long do you expect to be doing it, once you land it?
* Which skills do you think are required?
* How do you plan on acquiring them?

## In the biomedical sciences of yesteryear 
* Which do you consider the most important accomplishments in the field?
* Which bioscientists do you admire (if any) and for which achievement?
* What made them great? Which skills did they possess that made them stand out? 

## In the biomedical sciences of today
* Which do you consider to be the most important problems and open questions?
* What do you think it will take to solve them?

## A note on obsolescence 
* Which problems that made people great,famous and admirable would still be relevant today had it not been for them?
* Which of the problems that you consider important, you think will still be relevant in 10,20,50 years from now?

## Which skill do you need to possess/acquire to become a good scientist?
* Which of them are innate and which are transferable?
* Which are important and which you can forget about?
* Which ones are permanent and will stick with you and which you will need to update?

## Lets break them down a bit
* Theory, information, knowledge skills (the stuff you get from textbooks, lectures, papers)
* Methods (the stuff you get from working at the bench, doing internships)
* What else?

## Which qualities do you consider *essential* for a scientist?
